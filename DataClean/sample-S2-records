The mercury content of nails in such patients was extremely high (1720 mg/l). The urinary level of mercury after dimercaprol injection was 1.97 mg/l, about 400 times above the upper limit of normal (0.005 mg/l). The poisoning was apparently caused by the use of mercury-containing bleaches (about 5% and 6% Hg) which do not require prescription and are marketed without any statement about composition or possible side-effects. The cases are a warning against uncontrolled use of external application of mercury-containing preparations.","inCitations":["00a5fe4f64d34161515e05092533806be917ea7b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Nail changes and loss of hair: cardinal signs of mercury poisoning from hair bleaches (author's transl)].","doi":"10.1055/s-0028-1106446","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0028-1106446","venue":"Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift"}

The results show that high-frequency participants submit orders at multiple prices in the limit order book, concentrated at or within the quote. This activity translates into the provision of liquidity on an on-going basis, which is robust to fast versus slow and volatile markets, together suggesting that high-frequency participants resolve temporal liquidity imbalances in the limit order book. The evidence is consistent with high-frequency trading (HFT) improving market liquidity, but there remain issues surrounding high-frequency participants’ effect on market depth and the difficulty of trading of non-HFT participants.","inCitations":["a28003a929451f482897f6682c4e61cd167802b5","2ecaf2ce45665476fddcf59e93bd6d8a0e464ece","6ea66439e7680f8ee6601add8b94226699c189a8","5984d0f084eaf0b28dc65e720ec74fe44c65616c","1887f7df3685599dd5867acc7a16170c62ff4104","09b29b2751a4198f1009ae3c2c0cf9f944e8aa68","626c782e27f54d55a4a04fd5771c8c2c61084d36","65f658dae5bdeeadff763756ce2055d2d04d0977","91742383a3ce8acf0c6e9de829aeb3df6cb9ec11","330c44ab87b6ce941551a3b38efb0d554d47a28b","6f160c9c47911ae831ad45ef618c929e7ba91680","166043786188961500c451bb7281fc521e395890","cdbe49ca8307c08674407980ff9eb6b77ed02684","71836709daae8d00bd401e506af1ad72d9ae235e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Provision of Liquidity by High‐Frequency Participants","doi":"10.1111/fire.12040","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/fire.12040","venue":""}

These devices provide various services to users. The cloud messaging service, especially, is applied to many various services, and sends messages asynchronously. In the cloud messaging service, there are two methods for message transmission, message transmission based on an IP address and a publish/subscribe technique. Each technique uses basic messages in order to send messages to mobile devices. In this paper, the hybrid message transmission, based on user-customized analysis to reduce basic messages, is proposed. The hybrid message transmission uses Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and K-means algorithms for user-customized analysis, and determines the message transmission techniques in each timeslot.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Method for Hybrid Message Transmission based on User-Customized Analysis","doi":"10.5626/JOK.2015.42.7.939","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5626/JOK.2015.42.7.939","venue":""}

A prominent feature of this process is the postconfluent development of multicellular, three-dimensional nodules that rise above the surrounding monolayer. Formation of the nodules suggests that changes in cellular adhesion occur during this cellular overgrowth. Therefore changes in the distribution of cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion plaque proteins were examined with respect to estradiol induction of nodule development. Estradiol treatment of the carcinoma cell line had the following effects: (1) vinculinand talin-rich cell-matrix adhesion plaques were reduced in overall number and size in confluent and postconfluent cultures. No overt change in distribution or morphology of adhesion plaques was observed in subconfluent cultures. (2) Staining for vinculin was reduced in cell-cell adhesions situated at the apical region of subconfluent, confluent and postconfluent monolayers. Staining for F-actin and plakoglobin was retained at this region in estradiol-induced cells. (3) vinculin was not detected in intercellular adhesions of nodule cells although intense labelling for both F-actin and plakoglobin was observed. In addition, in untreated monolayer cells, both F-actin and plakoglobin were concentrated in a subapical/basolateral location, as a vesicle-like pattern, which corresponded to intercellular spaces observed with phase-contrast microscopy. Treatment with estradiol caused the rearrangement of subapical/ basolateral F-actin and plakoglobin staining into a more uniform pattern. The findings of this study show that estradiol induces changes in both cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesions in an estrogenresponsive carcinoma cell line. The gradual loss of vinculin from cell-matrix and cell-cell adherens junctions of the monolayer could be a potential factor in the capacity of these cells to form multilayers or nodules in postconfluent growth. Furthermore, the development of the nodules in response to estradiol may provide a useful system in which to study steroid hormone regulation of adhesion and the cytoskeleton in responsive tumor cells.","inCitations":["df5873a9b6e51d6e80ad5b5bce607588184915cf","2c1b7632452e960296d8bc711b72729d4943515e","1510f1b3edde15eabd74ca9ea76619403e0f6b5c","ab87c4ac19b1e5db2d158b1505bb4f29a89c36b4"],"pdfUrls":["http://jcs.biologists.org/content/joces/107/5/1241.full.pdf"],"title":"1241 17-β-Estradiol induced alterations of cell-matrix and intercellular adhesions in a human mammary carcinoma cell line","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Automatic detection, location, and tracking of targets outside protected area ensures maximum protection and at the same time reduces the workload on personnel, increases reliability and confidence of target detection, and enables both man-in-the-loop and fully automated system operation. Thermal imaging provides the benefits of all-weather, 24-hour day/night operation with no downtime. In addition, thermal signatures of different target types facilitate better classification, beyond the limits set by camera's spatial resolution. The useful range of catadioptric panoramic cameras is affected by their limited resolution. In many existing systems the resolution is optics-limited. Reflectors customarily used in catadioptric imagers introduce aberrations that may become significant at large camera apertures, such as required in low-light and thermal imaging. Advantages of panoramic imagers with high image resolution include increased area coverage with fewer cameras, instantaneous full horizon detection, location and tracking of multiple targets simultaneously, extended range, and others. The Automatic Panoramic Thermal Integrated Sensor (APTIS), being jointly developed by Applied Science Innovative, Inc. (ASI) and the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) combines the strengths of improved, high-resolution panoramic optics with thermal imaging in the 8 - 14 micron spectral range, leveraged by intelligent video processing for automated detection, location, and tracking of moving targets.

In the structure-TLD system, the secondary mass is liquid and the damping forces primarily result from the motion of liquid through an energy dissipating device such as damping screens. The primary difference from a TMD is the amplitude dependent nature of a TLD. It would be beneficial to provide TLDs with variable damping that can be adjusted through a certain mechanism to achieve an optimal control performance over a wide range of loading conditions in a semi-active mode of control. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous study has considered structural control of tall buildings using semi-active TLDs. In this paper, a control strategy based on a gain scheduling scheme is utilized by controlling the inclination angle of the damping screen(s) and consequently the screen loss coefficient value(s). The gain scheduling control strategy is employed on a three dimensional single-story structure equipped with a semi-active TLD in order to maintain the optimal damping value (ζTLD−opt) based on a prescribed look-up table.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ocs.soton.ac.uk/index.php/rasdconference/RASD2013/paper/download/1300/108"],"title":"Development and Validation of a Finite Element Structure Semi-active Tuned Liquid Damper System Model","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Originally, the exceptionally high reaction temperatures of this hetero variant of the well-known 3,3-sigmatropic reaction limited their applicability to selected molecules. Since about 1970, charge acceleration enabled a signifi- cant reduction of the reaction temperature to be achieved, and cation- and anion-promoted rearrangements found their way into the syntheses of more complex molecules. The first to- tal syntheses of natural products were reported. The development of zwitterionic aza-Claisen rearrangements allowed the reactions to be run at room temperature or below, and the charge neutralization served as the highly efficient driving force. After overcoming several teething troubles, the method was established as a reliable conversion displaying various stereochemical advantages. The first successful total syntheses of natural products incorpo- rating the aza-Claisen rearrangement as a key step emphasized the synthetic potential. To date the aza-Claisen rearrangements are far from being exhausted. Still, an enantioselectively catalyzed variant has to be developed. This review summarizes one decade of investigation efforts in this area.","inCitations":["a1fab73b8c297ce6a6abf480b040a679e1cf90f6","6f59ca19b5924e26911d17b6db85a907bea429fb","2300ebf682eac626948a85b45355d03e26b24c98","8f07bd46e8ef6a6bb28f9e0881c3b0fca0a9bf5f"],"pdfUrls":["http://showme.physics.drexel.edu/mirza/Software/JCAMP/Icons/Dissertation/Proposal/Aza-Claisen%20Rearrangement.pdf"],"title":"Recent Advances in Charge-Accelerated Aza-Claisen Rearrangements","doi":"10.1002/chin.200536281","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/chin.200536281","venue":""}

Thus, the period from conception through pregnancy to early infancy is uniquely sensitive to long-lasting effects of environmental insults, potentially leading to physiological malprogramming and lifelong disease. Beyond the classical association between low birth weight and increased coronary mortality in adulthood, peri-conceptional and perinatal insults can set the scene for later obesity, cancer and behavioral disorders. Taking the developmental programming of hypertension as an example, this review addresses the remarkably similar mechanisms of early programming, particularly those involving the kidney and vasculature ; the continuum between normality and disease ; the role of early and later nutrition ; and early biomarkers and epigenetic mechanisms of later cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The developmental origins of adult health and disease represent a global research challenge as emerging countries undergo major nutritional and environmental upheavals. Much research is focused on the benefits of early nutritional and lifestyle interventions, in both animal models and human studies.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Early origins of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine"}

In developing a state-to-state DSMC collision model, one key aspect is to propose efficient algorithms to correctly simulate the state-to-state collision cross-sections, hence the state-to-state collision (or transition) rates. This includes the calculation of the total collision rate, the selection of potential collision pairs, and the procedure to perform actual state-to-state collisions in the DSMC method. To achieve these tasks in a computationally efficient manner, we proposed the detailed implementation of a general rovibrational state-to-state collision model for the DSMC method. The proposed model implementation successfully achieved microscopic reversibility, detailed balance, and equipartition of energy under equilibrium conditions. This was first demonstrated using qualitatively-constructed state-to-state cross-sections. With the algorithms verified, we further developed a vibrational state-to-state DSMC collision model using the transition probabilities of the forced harmonic oscillator (FHO) model, where the transition probabilities are modified to satisfy microscopic reversibility, and a power law temperature dependent viscosity is imposed. Furthermore, DSMC simulation results of isothermal vibration relaxation using the modified FHO cross-sections are compared with master equation simulation results, where the transition rates in the master equation are obtained from integrating the state-to-state cross-sections used in the DSMC simulation. Overall, excellent agreement is observed for both the vibrational temperature relaxation history and the time dependent vibrational energy distribution functions, between DSMC and master equation simulations.","inCitations":["3e28b88336a894eb5858158b3fe46c7f807d7999","5b40830f978e0f1e3dc62ba7ae92d4b89b559548"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Consistent implementation of state-to-state collision models for direct simulation Monte Carlo","doi":"10.2514/6.2014-0866","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2014-0866","venue":""}

Methods:The 500 mL soft plastic reservoir bag was connected to the bubble CPAP system.The leak pathway and a valve were prepared to simulate the function of the mouth. The pressure and flow in the regions corresponding to the lower airway (Pdistal)and the leak flow were recorded simultaneously using a flow analyzer. Results:At a bias flow of 3 L/min,use of a reservoir bag resulted in a significant decline of the pressure swing magnitude at 60 and 90 breaths/min.A reservoir bag attenuated the rapid aspiration-induced decreases of the mean airway pressure.When bubbling disappeared due to complete opening of the leak valve,the mean airway pressure was maintained at approximately 2 cmH O.Additionally,the mean airway pressure increased with increasing bias flow even under 100% leak condition. Conclusions:Even when a large leak occurs,a low but significant airway pressure is loaded under moderate bias flow.Inclusion of a reservoir bag in the bubble CPAP may offer an effective and inexpensive option for providing respiratory support to preterm infants.Shinshu Med J 61: 65―73, 2013 (Received for publication December 18,2012;accepted in revised form January 8,2013)","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://s-igaku.umin.jp/DATA/61_02/61_02_04.pdf"],"title":"Functional Evaluation of Bubble CPAP for Neonates Using a Leak Model","doi":"10.11441/shinshumedj.61.65","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11441/shinshumedj.61.65","venue":""}

In this context, a pair of new manganese(I) tricarbonyl species, based on the N,N’-coordinated 1,10-phenanthroline-​5,​6-​dione (phen-dione) ligand, have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods and X-ray diffraction. They exhibit excellent selectivity for homogeneous catalytic CO2 reduction to CO or HCOOH through electrochemical or photochemical activation, respectively. Under the latter particularly, switching the solvent from dimethylformamide to acetonitrile remarkably enhances the selectivity of the reduction reaction towards formic acid. To obtain deeper mechanistic insight, the evolution of the catalysts and products in solution during the catalytic processes was investigated by combined electrochemical, chromatographic and spectroscopic methods It has been shown that the presence of the π-accepting, redox-active phen-dione ligand leads to different reduced intermediates compared with standard 2,2′-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline complexes, with the two first redox processes remaining localized on the ligand.","inCitations":["e4dfcf42d24e2464f0660c2a36f496dc85194234"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mn-carbonyl molecular catalysts containing a redox-active phenanthroline-5,6-dione for selective electro- and photoreduction of CO 2 to CO or HCOOH","doi":"10.1016/j.electacta.2017.04.080","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2017.04.080","venue":""}

N-1 local probabilities of false alarm are selected as optimization variables. And the encoding intervals for local false alarm probabilities are sequentially designed by the person-by-person optimization technique according to the constraints. By turning constrained optimization to unconstrained optimization, the problem of increasing iteration times due to the punishment technique frequently adopted in the genetic algorithm is thus overcome. Then this optimization scheme is applied to spacebased synthetic aperture radar (SAR) multi-angle collaborative detection, in which the nominal factor for each local detector is determined. The scheme is verified with simulations of cases including two, three and four independent SAR systems. Besides, detection performances with varying K and N are compared and analyzed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Parallel Distributed CFAR Detection Optimization Based on Genetic Algorithm with Interval Encoding","doi":"10.1016/S1000-9361(09)60226-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1000-9361%2809%2960226-0","venue":""}

Irbesartan has previously been shown to effectively lower blood pressure (BP) in high-risk groups including patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or nephropathy, and may therefore also be suitable for the treatment of obesity-associated hypertension. In this study we aimed to: (a) assess the efficacy and tolerability of irbesartan alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in patients with obesity-associated mild-to-moderate hypertension; and (b) investigate patient-associated determinants of poor BP control in this patient group.\n Patients and methods: This was a 3-month, prospective, open-label, multicentre, phase IV study in 72 479 hypertensive patients in 6989 general practices across Germany. Main outcome measures were BP reduction (primary parameter of effectiveness) and BP response rates after 3 months, as well as adverse events (AEs). Independent predictors of poor control were identified in a multivariate proportional odds model.\n Results: All of the patients were Caucasian, 50.5% were females, mean age was 62.1 ± 11.1 years, mean bodyweight was 88.6 ± 15.4kg, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.7 ± 4.8 kg/m2. Almost all the patients were overweight or obese (92.3%). From a baseline value of 162/94mm Hg, systolic and diastolic BP were reduced by a mean of −23/−12mm Hg after 3 months. 66.1% of the patients were responders (reduction of diastolic BP ≥10mm Hg), and 48.0% achieved BP normalisation (i.e. <140/90mm Hg). 79% of patients met their individual treatment goals as defined by the treating physician (mean 135/80mm Hg). AEs were reported in only 322 patients (0.4%). Factors requiring special attention in patients not achieving BP control were age (>55 years), high BMI category (>25 kg/m2), and increased waist circumference.\n Conclusion: Treatment with irbesartan (± hydrochlorothiazide) appeared to be effective and well tolerated in the study population of patients with obesity-associated hypertension. Easily recognisable characteristics allow physicians to identify patients whose BP is likely to be difficult to control.","inCitations":["948ea454087312965d75621ad067086278c8bd6f","188e0366138f2ab070201a8b84ff087d4cac6f18","7ba068517e29c9c61afe3851760fe8c31c770371","fe724b9d181ca5f61a7f951278085263079abc65","ad40af43cc1a21fc8a2251f220a6a1ebb35afa95","c37310d1f5f0346f07db47315d1cd6ee2c6ec96e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antihypertensive Effect of Irbesartan and Predictors of Response in Obesity- Associated Hypertension","doi":"10.2165/00044011-200525120-00003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2165/00044011-200525120-00003","venue":"Clinical drug investigation"}

Three kinds of general cosmetics and nanometal-containing cosmetics were poured into petri dish and exposed to air for 24 hr and then mixed with a culture medium, in which bacteria were not grown during cultivating for 48 hr. Three kinds of general cosmetics and nanometal-containing cosmetics were contaminated artificially by stirring with fingers and incubated at 30oC for 10 days. When the contaminated cosmetics were mixed with the culture medium, various bacteria grew. The bacteria grown in the mixture of cosmetics and culture medium were identified with Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Kocuria rosea, Dermacoccus sp. Bacillus thringiensis, Staphyllococcus sp and Paenibacillus campinasensis , Streptomyces sp, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens based on the GenBank database and 16S-rDNA sequence homology. The bacteria contaminated the cosmetics are not pathogenic but found generally in soils, waters and around human life. Bacterial cell number grown in the general cosmetics and nanometal-containing cosmetics by the artificial contamination was 50~90 per g of cosmetic and 4~26 per g of cosmetic, respectively. These results present a clue that nano-sized platinum or silver particle contained in the nanometal-containing cosmetics may influence negatively on bacterial growth.

For this purpose, nanopores are fabricated in heavy ion irradiated polyethylene terephthlate (PET) membranes by a controlled chemical track-etching technique, which leads to the generation of carboxyl (COOH) groups on the pore surface. End-functionalized polymer chains are immobilized onto the inner pore walls via a 'grafting-to' approach through the covalent linkage of surface COOH moieties with the terminal amine groups of the PNIPAAM molecules by using carbodiimide coupling chemistry. The success of the chemical modification reaction is corroborated by measuring the permeation flux of charged analytes across the multipore membranes in an aqueous solution, and for the case of single conical pore by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, which are dictated by the electrostatic interaction of the charged pore surface with the mobile ions in an electrolyte solution. The effective nanopore diameter is tuned by manipulating the environmental temperature due to the swelling/shrinking behaviour of polymer brushes attached to the inner nanopore walls, leading to a decrease/increase in the ionic transport across the membrane. This process should permit the thermal gating and controlled release of ionic drug molecules through the nanopores modified with thermoresponsive polymer chains across the membrane.","inCitations":["470011ea27f3680d17481887dc738c34589d564c","2cc44e9d280459a6ade4e8abb60a9aca7ebd89d5","7478e8bee5f41a23c717f1af9325ea6ab2fe6779","79e634732e1055cac9b43de3fdd8f8dacd8be79a","189b6b0b7105a45af1db8c7e3d7f9c529b455822","3225492f9d418a6db7325497e8d2abe519f1f6a1","082c9311da098dcc62ecbfedb32f6b6e3bc768a2","7c3b31772819c4223b57163188d1ee0467b11421","d0fbacde9953fcaa54c446af7d2c8256255d9715","3bc7d9c2fc423cb25d3ac50667785e65b6ddc5a0","e338645e7b8c0d10430aeccfde7d5fce10657f84","5afe3f623fb83518a6406d41ab44ea3420dd306f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thermally controlled permeation of ionic molecules through synthetic nanopores functionalized with amine-terminated polymer brushes.","doi":"10.1088/0957-4484/23/22/225502","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0957-4484%2F23%2F22%2F225502","venue":"Nanotechnology"}

Silent pavements and noise barriers are well-known, but are there other alternative or additional measures? The company 4Silence developed a sound diffracting element (Whisstone); a concrete element with cavities that is placed alongside the road at the same level as the road surface. The diffracting element deflects tyre -road noise in an upward direction, creating a zone of noise reduction behind the element. It can therefore act as a complement to existing noise-reducing measures and can be optimized for maximum noise reduction. In theory, this acoustic phenomenon can be very effective, but does it work in practice? For a theoretical description and the results of model based research, see the accompanying paper of Y.H. Wijnant. Experiments have been done on different types of Whisstone diffracting elements in combination with several road surface types. In 2012 and 2013 this innovation was constructed at two sites along a secondary road. This paper shows the approach of the measurements and the results. The Whisstone elements seem to be an interesting innovation which can increase noise reduction up to 4 dB.","inCitations":["5d3b383653d6b772f0312f9d47da6ebd171cc96e","eb8143cbc5a11791099aaaccbe1f277106dc33f4"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.mp.nl/sites/all/files/publicaties/Hooghwerff-Whisstone-Euronoise%202015.pdf","https://www.conforg.fr/euronoise2015/proceedings/data/articles/000431.pdf"],"title":"Whisstone, a sound diffractor: does it really affect traffic noise?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The paper examines the role of the human factor in ensuring the safety of energy objects following the introduction of intellectual power systems. To assess and improve the reliability of an employee, the authors suggest using a safety profile, which includes such characteristics as the knowledge and understanding of safety rules and procedures, adherence to the culture of safety, professional expertise, moral and psychological stability, absence of addictions or high vulnerability to external environment. The use of this approach will help fulfill the task of taking into account and assessing the human factor in ensuring the safety of electric power objects.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The role of human factor in ensuring the safety of electric power objects after their intellectualization","doi":"10.1109/IFOST.2016.7884273","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFOST.2016.7884273","venue":"2016 11th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST)"}

For longitudinal studies with missing ordinal data, where the Gaussian assumption is no longer valid, application of the data augmentation method is questionable. In the following, consider a sample of N subjects and let Y be an ordinal outcome variable with K levels assessed on T occasions on each subject.

Treatment of B6D2F1 mice carrying intra-footpad B16 melanoma with 35 mg/kg/day NAMI-A for 6 days reduces metastasis weight independently of whether NAMI-A is given before or after surgical removal of the primary tumor. Metastasis reduction is unrelated to NAMI-A concentration, which is 10-fold lower than on primary site (1 versus 0.1 mM), and is correlated to the reduction of plasma gelatinolitic activity and to the decrease of cells expressing CD44, CD54, and integrin-beta(3) adhesion molecules. Metastatic cells also show the reduction of the S-phase cells with accumulation in the G(0)/G(1) phase. In vitro, on the highly metastatic B16F10 cell line, NAMI-A reduces cell Matrigel invasion and its ability to cross a layer of endothelial cells after short exposure (1 h) to 1 to 100 microM concentrations. In these conditions, NAMI-A reduces the gelatinase activity of tumor cells, and it also increases cell adhesion to poly-L-lysine and, in particular, to fibronectin, and this effect is associated to the increase of F-actin condensation. This work shows the selective effectiveness of NAMI-A on the metastatic melanoma and suggests that metastasis inhibition is due to the negative modulation of tumor cell invasion processes, a mechanism in which the reduction of the gelatinolitic activity of tumor cells plays a crucial role.","inCitations":["7da957425687c6e650bd1ea55e5da2f19275691f","8c1cd2f312c729d9d59cfcaf2969affc284db14f","fe2f6d8ef1330b9e41b8799f81c351c29b06001e","e5c0c6a3f6eaa002fc5d91b72ba3e9e0060eeefb","aba104e42489d3d352d60fa8fb0266b732c5471d","8aeaeeac2418f63e5a99f7acbdcdad2cb510f2f2","e91d960a17064bb5276ddf43d9fc8b1ed7174f15","77b1785819d904c3510b9e9a8a8f417060e6269a","90ff5ad678d2c984039c58cfc19efeb511013cc9","9cfcf04925bf12953f041b5032adf8e323c33914","4ea7ae8ec6dc0f15ef70fe95306cf7dd931356a5","b8da21b223eedfdf862623e5b7f7251b701d3117","aeec9be250e5f36e60191b0df3c2ef800c7e80ca","733d4320a30f9921eef61b80aba43551370792f6","7b573ff860e4ee9fd96adaef64c338e4908fb293","ed037d78815e8173c2da081c5b48bf0f0c9e2f94","b3f3c0f2650ea0b07d790dcd78860741ecdb80ff","b4824a17712c86f46970818e2d9068d7dd132eff","63c611b79a15d653ca8ca8a1b24f7a9f94e8548d","b0c82ab9b5b42075f2951c9795b6e002a2e659af","afa7c5aee7980e9a34fa54c88812c4b2f84b6de4","c01bc3e9e61480e85be0774ac4bcc028c8a45fd6","983d91f87dbf84fe9cbac6329f0334b2d21b1d01","8c35bb6b47aec6b9586cbe754b336e7792fb5657","9972678dd7ff84ef18af817dae64c4ac9c159f99"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inhibition of B16 melanoma metastases with the ruthenium complex imidazolium trans-imidazoledimethylsulfoxide-tetrachlororuthenate and down-regulation of tumor cell invasion.","doi":"10.1124/jpet.105.095141","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.105.095141","venue":"The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics"}

To investigate this uncertainty, we stimulated secretion of 1,25-(OH)2-D with a 24-hour intravenous infusion of synthetic human parathyroid hormone fragment 1-34 and compared the results in normal young adults and elderly patients with untreated osteoporosis. Serum levels of 1,25-(OH)2-D were similar in both groups (49 +/- 10 and 42 +/- 9 pg per milliliter [116 +/- 24 and 99 +/- 21 pmol per liter]) before the infusion. However, during the 24-hour infusion, serum levels nearly doubled (P less than 0.01) in the normal volunteers but did not change significantly in the patients. Serum ionized calcium increased and serum inorganic phosphate decreased similarly in both groups during the infusion (P less than 0.05). Although the present study does not establish whether deficient 1,25-(OH)2-D secretory reserve is an effect of age or of osteoporosis, it is possible that such a deficiency will explain the inability of elderly osteoporotic patients to adapt to the low-calcium diets common in this age group. If so, this phenomenon may play a part in the pathogenesis of age-related osteoporosis.","inCitations":["925f3f3cae62068cfeac8d2f271774a6cafe2000","6585895248832ea0a1266151da85c33339804034","424d2bf2b3b30982baad9c3f228416f65cd43f33","727432cf434494f493ba768fee70ce4decf0e608","41892acf3e8f5007d27277c9e447a8780cc6e468","5d2601e428d3630d9af78b6c91c96822f4d1c7b3","30530556a5b2080e556283bd4fd403f48221034b","4043a8d4c54d942e193251817f56d1827d1d96ce","d116295105290e631dd71fd32faf8973e6689de6","c70dd4c9b1a8a20662802fe95bae7a5a20fe154f","5ce6d3d93e7e81e3ef694053f70986dcf8043d94","8365d997fd01976bcdabde8ac27723b6f4d0b12f","e6a169f9f557c153cb1296a649db4429b72fbe1a","d198c4a03bfcf5c62b2b0ea058b92930b712043f","7d7ab3da4c5947e6a7302803b7c3b0daa969571d","7bef65e1423032356789025fe5e63667a7b98216","2ceaba792c19ea0961eb5e19e6ee79746cdddc14","e0a7013e8d3c1d101ecde87ef4e8f413c12bb207","847a04b9a994f4369b7dd8ea72189b5447957fb9","8a54c54afc69a969e52b76c4d897a66870f7d44d","ba9f7097df649fca1d8735859e5ab6e525b124c6","c1b9759623f6552bf278414db08a32dac5dd6599","7f2d066b6c49cc383435efe2d201dae34ef87cc0","8a3d8682e1e45cd7938ce98bea2187ab1470d845","4f71cf5a8a029382892ac52b6b768504d8a83996","a0e8eed7fd75b0037439ef2b0ebc086ca5e2f104","f3cbe4e25ffc094071690450249840ec71236a29","be336eac8091ba0eb3a7f8642907dd25e33ff923","9ef8edf204895c315b55ae6009fc3d46f2a21c00","c2d25796fc84311a7144c439eebf60aa53d45935","9bb11d5252835a52669dcb7b285b792b27171754","b67aa18e32b7d1f5a0c340f6430842a7b971e145","e1be695ad4f3bb392cb08a3be488cc789ab29186","e6470a51511dc2493b614ee137618ad31888fe2d","af2f24f012153a9b1874b0507bf477bd9f6b01f7","7238d8b0c6500ebc7360b9cdb1c10a247dffba1d","d512a36ff8c7f7f7e4881444a8fe3fcdfbdbc1d3","bb2f5dcb45cc5f1d5db52f880beb78a4343428af","0aa554d7a24328711832544273f686e91b7b9851","0ba47e4d213fd65df211a688aeffb8835fb7e87c","d02c7474116e26b061808c7c60cd51f94e800498","b099f16d24d29f514b097caeac97936e8de402a6","a7ec86350a42146eed22470793f31a89f64dc310","244c99ec9d41d916323f3a6b9a61c0f2de093012","23da0b46cc66de5458b1787c71ba8e794b1694df","9bfaefd7005c800f1c3363d6473d850fbfc80a76","cd462bbfd90ef4c341fffd4486f0f207d775bbb5","f8a65469de5965730dee56d54bc37254da8e1bcd","d3ccd7378fa37181d0c08ddaa8561cdbde3b82f6","af385a17b16a3c47b5db687fe1b7f8bf3a17a034","92b1e928c6c40d48f487586b2c1d128f9c2bc935","142224a7a0989d2550c807ea3d12bf24bab53f4f","ccaebd3fce0b47d04147a2c83e8fe0d76b1941a3","b901acfefaa6ec191ba15fb7a7ac1b7291f5f435","f9eac4d19735f310a66036155a101cae44c56156","aa3b82da374cd2fca98a4abb7dbd87f04c0adbc7","11e442f45f0314370beedd410061ccb068383ed3","a0be54e18df4f9259db4507d6f8fc9ccf2d5f8d5","c04b587ee5a2cb7a7db795b9ff0107f51f8b25ce","8104270f6ca64a53bab16a4da1d0066d83ffe608","246bfc3aad2b055e9f41c587a54a743fd39c023d","43afe58cb578e16f2ff56322549eea5316f722b5","d3d451b107b3e3c6820c07a2fd026bf40dee2cba","1a4b63ccf25cbd41960a887cc5855d9c0e9f5b15","0b3b90664360ce1e495cf3c51fed8cb8bd17d825","5c1bffeba67c6003fb98c97ca02591a5897259fc","9323453232b2a19ccba8918e6e5d0159ebc54c19","331706dc91cda541f3ffab744e2b0979fc9134ed","e753187d2425c5618c85e3c4f678794b615b084a","98d517e2e035a7e11d9be4051afeca168273f9f3","fda7b5ba9ab925024c307f946eda9537e7345483","4609eaa810004efbe9ffa24c02754e6332cac7a0","0eecfac0082f854d918f7995b6896912c79b4328","1676a2eb6f1c96dd82899f34974c56f08d1eab14","e7d1790b853d67f77af354ede4735962841b7da3","8b20b3ea89ee1e4c6bb7bc5aa35db152e462be68","7ae9db8102f5716d52acbe6ea791f6ea69b9a246","034fa6cf0d25b40d8f749bff746ca85d1aa5f179","263323f4eea8490267d33ed2540f46367cc2c4ad","cf958d03fae7a719d953fac9536ac752fd3c5541","cb4c4e58cfd66dbf957fc14661d31bbe1603fead","39ad846b9297f518fb3893e664fa053a855c8ac3","72ab3fa74d173cd2a36f608787c5f387e03d17e6","7ebe18eb21bd54cd62fbd7265e9544d5598d0f54","c55ac508afe4d7182c274fe6b259c7ca963304e7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Deficient production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in elderly osteoporotic patients.","doi":"10.1056/NEJM198108133050704","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM198108133050704","venue":"The New England journal of medicine"}

Narratiewe genres wat in hierdie konteks ontstaan, word betekenisvol deur die deelnemende eienskappe van die omringende diskoerskonteks gevorm. Fanie Viljoen se grafiese verhaal Pynstiller/Painkiller, met die tema van selfskending onder tieners, is in twee weergawes op twee verskillende platforms en netwerkkontekste gepubliseer, naamlik as deel van 'n Facebook-groep en as selfoonverhaal op Yoza Cellphone Stories. Hierdie artikel beskryf die publikasiekontekste, interaktiwiteit en wisselwerking ten opsigte van die Pynstiller-weergawes aan die hand van Ruth Page (2010) se teorie van narratiewe wisselwerking waarin gebruiker-teks-wisselwerking (leser-teks) sowel as die diskoerskonteks van die gebruiker-gebruiker-wisselwerking (leser-leser) in ag geneem word. Dit blyk dat die interaktiwiteit en wisselwerking in die onderskeie diskoersnetwerke unieke kenmerke toon, ongeag dat dieselfde primere narratief ter sprake is. Die gevolgtrekking is dat die skrywer van die kernnarratief 'n belangrike en selfs bepalende rol in die ontwikkelende narratief kan speel.\nThe author and new publication contexts : interactivity and interaction among online communities - Fanie Viljoen's Pynstiller/Painkiller as a case study\nThe Web 2.0 context, where interactivity and cooperation between multiple readers are possible, creates unique dynamics and narrative forms. For the author the participatory environment offers new narrative and publication possibilities. The need arises for a better understanding of this changing environment, the online interaction and the developing creative forms. Globally there are big differences in terms of available technology, internet access and user patterns, and therefore it is also necessary to investigate and describe the narrative practices in local contexts.\nThis article discusses two versions of South African author Fanie Viljoen's graphic novel Pynstiller/Painkiller, which were published on two different platforms and network contexts. Pynstiller (Painkiller) had its origins in a creative and research project with artists' books and practice-based research as its focus. In the project Transgressions and boundaries of the page Viljoen adapted his own short story with the theme of self-mutilation among teenagers to a graphic novel. Simultaneously with the remediation of the story Viljoen also established a Facebook group, placed the completed pages on it and started a conversation about the topical theme of self-mutilation. The novel later became available as a cell phone novel (in English and Afrikaans) on Yoza Cellphone Stories, with the graphics adapted to the dimensions of a standard cell phone screen. Yoza cellphone stories can be read on the Yoza mobisite, among others, which also makes provision for readers' comments. The reader responses and interactions that were observed in the different network contexts offer an opportunity to use this work as a case study to examine the dynamics between the author, text, context and reader in online communities in Web 2.0 contexts. Ruth Page's (2010) theory of narrative interaction as explained in her article \"Interactivity and interaction: Text and talk in online communities\" serves as the theoretical framework for the investigation.\nThe article is organised in the following sections: (1) contextualisation in terms of the participatory culture in Web 2.0 contexts and Page's theory of narrative interaction; (2) the text and publication contexts of Fanie Viljoen's Pynstiller/Painkiller; (3) discussion of Page's theory with application to the interaction and interactivity in the Web 2.0 publication contexts of Pynstiller/Painkiller; (4) discussion of observed patterns and conversations in the Facebook Pynstiller group and Yoza Cellphone Stories; (5) conclusion and theory refinement.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://litnet.co.za/assets/pdf/Greyling_9_3_GW4.pdf","https://repository.nwu.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10394/17024/LitNet%20akademies-2012-9-Greyling.pdf;jsessionid=F6DDE10295C5E84CEBB710E1F9322AD6?sequence=1","https://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/litnet/9/3/litnet_v9_n3_a15.pdf?accname=guest&checksum=E96A521645315981607DC4B9C26E98BD&expires=1544373987&id=id"],"title":"Die skrywer en nuwe publikasiekontekste : interaktiwiteit en wisselwerking in aanlyngemeenskappe - Fanie Viljoen se Pynstiller as gevallestudie : geesteswetenskappe","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

INTRODUCTION The concept of infostation (1{3) presents a new way to look at the problem of providing high data rate wireless access. It is an isolated pocket area with small coverage (hundreds of meters) of high bandwidth connectivity that collects information requests from mobile users and delivers data while users are going through the coverage area. Infostations can be located in heavily populated areas such as airports, shops, pubs, hotels, and along highways. One of the technologies that have the potential to deliver the envisaged high-data rate infostation services is the UWB signaling (3). The UWB has the basic attributes of extremely low transmission power, operating at unlicensed frequency, high data rate, multipath immunity and low cost. Existing channel characterization and measurement for the UWB channel have been limited to the case where the channel is assumed to be stationary over the transmission duration. However, for many infostation scenarios, time variation is expected due to the mobility of one of the communication terminals/scatterers. Hence, the existing channel models cannot be used to describe this new target scenario where terminal mobility is expected. Time-varying channels are often modeled as stationary random processes using the concept of the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) assumption (4). Unfortunately, in time-varying UWB channel, the WSSUS assumption is invalid. The nature of the time-varying channel is such that the spatial structures of the multipath components, i.e., their number, time- of-arrivals (TOA), angle-of-arrivals (AOA) and magnitudes, change with time and location, leading to nonstationary statistics. Hence, non-WSSUS characterization (5,6) of the channel is required. For the UWB channel, the flne time resolution implies narrow delay bins which enable paths to move fast from one tap to another (7). Hence, the time evolution of the UWB channel cannot be decomposed into the time evolution of the individual taps, but of the individual paths. In this article, we present the measurement and the descriptions of channel parameters for the time-varying Infostation UWB channel. We also consider how such parameters can be used to improve system performance in terms of combating ICI in the case of multiband OFDM and mismatch in channel estimation. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the basic system model is specifled. The Infostation UWB channel measurement setup is presented in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to describing the post processing of the measurement data and the description of the how the channel parameters can be used to improve system performance in terms of optimally combating ISI and ICI in the case of multiband OFDM. 2.
