# CitationAnalysis
Analyzing citation data from Semantic Scholar to calculate self-citation rate per author, calculate H-index rate per author, and then calculate an adjusted H-index to take self-citation into account. How big an issue is self-citation and does it affect author's H-index scores?  We compare our results to published data using other databases.
